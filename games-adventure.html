                    <p>Objects in Space is an open world 2D stealth-action space trading game set in Apollo – a huge
                        cluster of star systems dozens of lightyears away from Earth. You are a ship’s captain, buying
                        and selling wares in order to keep your bucket o' bolts afloat and stay one step ahead of
                        pirates, organised criminals, corrupt governments and shady laws.</p>

                    <p>A galaxy of characters await you in Objects in Space. The game focuses on a myriad of short
                        stories rather than one main storyline with a hero’s journey, so it’s up to you how much or how
                        little narrative you want in your game.</p>

                    <p>Combat in Objects sees ships treated more like Cold War submarines than WWII dogfighters. You’ll
                        be running silent, planning manoeuvres far ahead of time and engaging in deadly games of
                        cat-and-mouse with nebulous enemies, but only for those players who seek it out. Combat-averse
                        players can pay attention to the news and avoid pirate-heavy systems and choose not to explore
                        the deadly uncharted areas of space where greater numbers of pirates lurk.</p>

                    <p>It’ll be up to you to keep your ship’s systems running as quietly as possible, going fully ‘dark’
                        if you have to, just floating with your current trajectory and speed hoping to avoid showing up
                        on anyone else’s scanners as you traverse some of the most dangerous shipping lanes in space.
                    </p>

                    <p>To make your money, there are over fifty employers and your reputation with each one will dictate
                        how many passenger, cargo or bounty-hunting contracts are available to you. But be warned -
                        failure to complete a contract might see your rep plummet with that employer. So when you get an
                        SOS signal from a nearby ship but have a deadline to keep, what will you do?</p>

                    <p>Your ship is completely customisable down to the tiniest component of each module. If your
                        battery dies, it’s your own fault. You can play it safe in the central systems or design your
                        ship with the ability to outrun, outfight or out-hide your opponents and make your fortune in
                        the outer rims. But be careful! You are just as easily prey as predator in deep space...</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>The Secret of Monkey Island (alternatively known as Monkey Island I) is a 1990 point-and-click
                        graphic adventure game developed and published by Lucasfilm Games. It takes place in a fantastic
                        version of the Caribbean during the age of piracy. The player assumes the role of Guybrush
                        Threepwood, a young man who dreams of becoming a pirate and explores fictional islands while
                        solving puzzles.</p>

                    <img src="./res/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland-shot00.jpg" alt="Screenshot of The Secret of Monkey Island">

                    <p>The game was conceived in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert, who designed it with Tim
                        Schafer and Dave Grossman. Gilbert's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles led him to
                        make the player character's death almost impossible, which meant that gameplay focused the game
                        on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park
                        ride. The Secret of Monkey Island was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine, which was
                        heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface.</p>

                    <p>The Secret of Monkey Island is a 2D adventure game played from a third-person perspective. Via a
                        point-and-click interface, the player guides protagonist Guybrush Threepwood through the game's
                        world and interacts with the environment by selecting from twelve verb commands (nine in newer
                        versions) such as "talk to" for communicating with characters and "pick up" for collecting items
                        between commands and the world's objects in order to successfully solve puzzles and thus
                        progress in the game. While conversing with other characters, the player may choose between
                        topics for discussion that are listed in a dialog tree; the game is one of the first to
                        incorporate such a system. The in-game action is frequently interrupted by cutscenes. Like
                        other LucasArts adventure games, The Secret of Monkey Island features a design philosophy that
                        makes the player character's death nearly impossible (Guybrush does drown if he stays underwater
                        for more than ten minutes).</p>
