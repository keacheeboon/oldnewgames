                        Set in the fantasy world of Spira, a setting influenced by the South Pacific, Thailand and
                        Japan, the game's story revolves around a group of adventurers and their quest to defeat a
                        rampaging monster known as Sin. The player character is Tidus, a star athlete in the fictional
                        sport of blitzball, who finds himself in the world Spira after his home city of Zanarkand is
                        destroyed by Sin. Shortly after arriving to Spira, Tidus joins the summoner Yuna on her
                        pilgrimage to destroy Sin.

                        The gameplay of Final Fantasy X differs from that of previous Final Fantasy games in its lack of
                        a top-down perspective world map. Earlier games featured a miniature representation of the
                        expansive areas between towns and other distinct locations, used for long-distance traveling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Final Fantasy X, almost all the locations are essentially continuous and never fade out to a
                        world map. Regional connections are mostly linear, forming a single path through the game's
                        locations, though an airship becomes available late in the game, giving the player the ability
                        to navigate Spira faster. Like previous games in the series, Final Fantasy X features numerous
                        minigames, most notably the fictional underwater sport "blitzball".

                        Since we are in 2019 now, it is recommended to grab FINAL FANTASY X/X-2 HD Remaster on Steam to
                        enjoy this germ at its glory, as it should be. Final Fantasy X-2 is the direct sequel to Final Fantasy X, which was released by Square Enix in 2003 due to latter's commercial and critical success.
