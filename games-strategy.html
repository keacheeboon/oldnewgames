                        Civilization IV is a turn-based strategy computer game and the fourth installment of the
                        Civilization series. It uses the 4X empire-building model for turn-based strategy gameplay, in
                        which the player's main objective is to construct a civilization from limited initial resources.
                        Most standard full-length games start the player with a settler unit and/or a city unit in the
                        year 4000 BC.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike previous installment, this game features a new graphics engine created from scratch,
                        based on the Gamebryo engine by Numerical Design Limited (NDL). The game has received critical
                        acclaim and was hailed as an exemplary product of one of the leading video game producers in the
                        turn-based strategy genre.

                        StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is a science fiction real-time strategy video game developed and
                        published by Blizzard Entertainment. It is a sequel to the 1998 video game StarCraft and its
                        expansion set Brood War.

                        The game features the return of the three species from the original game: Protoss, Terran, and
                        Zerg. In the Terran campaign, the original StarCraft briefing room is replaced with an
                        interactive version of the battlecruiser Hyperion, with Jim Raynor, now a bitter and
                        hard-drinking mercenary captain, as the central character.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a departure from previous Blizzard games, the campaign is non-linear, with Raynor taking jobs
                        for money and using that money to buy additional units and upgrades. Although each play through
                        will vary, the end result remains consistent, keeping the storyline linear. Blizzard's Vice
                        President Rob Pardo stressed that each campaign will function very differently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Terran campaign, Wings of Liberty, places players in a mercenary-style campaign, as Terran rebel
                        group Raynor's Raiders raise funds by taking assignments from outside groups. The second
                        release, Heart of the Swarm, is Zerg-focused and has role-playing elements. Kerrigan is the
                        focus of the campaign, and the story revolves around the possibility of her redemption. The
                        Protoss-themed Legacy of the Void is the final expansion, with the Protoss Artanis attempting to
                        reunite the Protoss tribes in order to stop Amon, a fallen Xel'Naga.
